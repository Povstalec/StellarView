Stellar View helps your sky look just a bit better while keeping the Vanilla feeling.

This mod is purely Client-side and **does not** need to be installed on a Server to work.
Which also means it **will not** physically change anything on the server-side and all changes it does make are purely visual.

This mod uses the [NeoForge](https://neoforged.net) modding API.
It's recommended to use IntelliJ with the [mcdev Plugin](https://mcdev.io).

Once the Gradle project is imported into IntelliJ you might need to restart it
so it recognizes the generated run configs.
