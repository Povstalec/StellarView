# Changelog
The list of changes that have been made during development. This is not an exhaustive list, some changes were most certainly forgotten about.

## 0.4.4 - 2025 Mar 07 - 1.19.2~1.19.4, 1.20.1, 1.21.1
- Added:
  - NGC 3109
  - stars_ignore_rain View Center field for Resourcepacks (allows stars to render even when it's raining)
  - Config options to specify Star and Dust Cloud brightness

- Changed:
  - Reduced the amount of dust clouds in all galaxies to increase performance on lower end computers
  - stretch is now split to star_stretch and dust_cloud_stretch

- Fixes:
  - Corrected Equatorial to Galactic coordinate conversion of galactic longtitude
  - Server crash on 1.21.1

## 0.4.3 - 2025 Jan 22 - 1.19.2~1.19.4, 1.20.1, 1.21.1
- Added:
  - stars_ignore_fog View Center field for Resourcepacks (allows stars to render even in foggy environments when set to true)

- Changed:
  - Star Info and Dust Cloud Info are now defined independently from Star Fields

## 0.4.2 - 2025 Jan 20 - 1.19.2~1.19.4, 1.20.1, 1.21.1
- Added:
  - Config option to enable Static Sky - Effectively a shader compatibility mode (don't expect shaders to automatically start working with the mod though, it will just make it is still up to each individual shader how it handles the sky.)
    - This is effectively a band-aid and it will 100% cause trouble for future development in the future, because it SEVERELY limits what can achieved with rendering. As of now, it only impacts Real-Time Gravitational Lensing, but don't be surprised if a feature is added in the future that does not show up while the Static Sky is active, since it uses vanilla core shaders, which are impractical for a lot of planned features.

## 0.4.1 - 2025 Jan 19 - 1.19.2~1.19.4, 1.20.1, 1.21.1
- Fixed:
  - Child Black Holes missing gravitational lensing effects

## 0.4.0 - 2025 Jan 17 - 1.19.2~1.19.4, 1.20.1, 1.21.1
- Added:
  - Pleiades, a famous star cluster
  - Minor moons around various planets. Most of these cannot be seen from Earth, and require the view center to be moved to the parent body.
    - Phobos and Deimos around Mars
    - Metis, Adrastea, Amalthea, Thebe, and Himalia around Jupiter
    - Hyperion, Phoebe, Janus, Epimethius, and Mimas around Saturn (Mimas is visible from Earth)
    - Puck, Sycorax, and Portia around Uranus
    - Proteus, Nereid, Larissa, Galatea, and Despina around Neptune
    - Hydra, Kerberos, Nix, and Styx around Pluto
  - Glacio (from Ad Astra) as a moon of Proxima C
  - More dwarf planets and their moons. These can't be seen from Earth either.
    - Eris with Dysnomia
    - Haumea with Namaka and Hi'iaka
    - Makemake with Emketu (MK2)
    - Gonggong with Xiangliu
    - Orcus with Vanth
    - Quaoar with Weywot
    - Salacia with Actea
    - Sedna
  - Config option to use game ticks instead of day ticks (game ticks are unaffected by time commands /time, meaning if you turn this option on, using /time set 0 will not reset the sky to its initial state; this, however, also means you will not be able to set the time to witness specific timed events, like Supernovae)
  - Tick Multiplier config option to speed up the rate at which the sky is simulated
  - API section with Javadocs, providing documentation for how to get the most out of Stellar View
  - Config option to disable gravitational lensing effects from black holes
  - Czech translation
  - German translation by **tristankechlo** (Povstalec added some translations that were missing, so if you notice anything wrong, please do tell him)

- Changed:
  - Changed some of the internal folder structure, potentially affecting dependancies
  - Planet is now an extension of the new ViewObject, which is an extension of OrbitingObject
  - View Centers now only accept ViewObjects as a valid "view_center"
  - Textured Space Objects should now properly fade with distance
  - Decreased nebula render distance, hopefully this should help making the region around Earth look less cluttered when viewed from outside of the Milky Way
  - Changed how blending during day is defined in View Centers, suns can now blend separately from other objects
  - Tweaked orbits and sizes of Proxima B, C, and D

- Fixed:
  - Supernovae not rotating properly
  - Server incompatability - servers will no longer crash when attempting to launch with Stellar View
  - Problems switching from textured to untextured stars during a single game session

- Added:
  - Gravitational lensing around Black Holes (still fairly work in progress, only affects Star Fields for now)
  - Galactic Dust Clouds
- Changed:
  - Stars can now use custom textures (for the sake of performance, one texture applies to an entire Star Field)

- **Updated to Minecraft 1.21.1 - HUGE thanks for the port to NeoForge 1.21.1 done entirely by Erdragh**
- Added:
  - Supernova 1987A
  - Synodic orbit JSON parameter to simplify moon orbit creation

## 0.3.0 - 2024 Oct 06 - 1.19.2~1.19.4, 1.20.1
- Added:
  - ***Resourcepack compatibility*** - Every single aspect of the mod can now be modified through the use of Resourcepacks. You can even add new objects to the sky.
  - ***View Center system*** - View Centers (which can be edited through Resourcepacks) can specify which planet (or any other object really) you're viewing the sky from. They will, by default, work with any dimension using dimension effects of Overworld, Nether and End. Any additional custom dimension effects added by mods can be easily edited into being compatible with the View Center system by their respective mod authors, if they choose to do so.
  - Conversion system for equatorial coordinates, allowing you to write down coordinates for any object using its J2000 epoch coordinates you can easily find for real-life space objects and make them appear where they should in-game.
  - Nebulae: Crab Nebula, Dumbell Nebula, Eagle Nebula, Lagoon Nebula, Orion Nebula, and Ring Nebula
  - Andromeda Galaxy
  - Triangulum Galaxy
  - Added Pegasus Dwarf Irregular Galaxy
  - Satellite galaxies: Antila 2, Crater 2 Dwarf, Large Magellanic Cloud, Small Magellanic Cloud, Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroid, M32, and M110
  - Alpha Centauri system: Rigil Kentaurus, Toliman, and Proxima Centauri, along with Proxima b, c, and d
- Fixed:
  - Minimized sky jitter caused by high time values (billions of ticks in the future)


## 0.2.4 - 2024 May 26 - 1.19.2~1.19.4, 1.20.1
- Changed:
  - Textures no longer use flipped UV by default (the Moon still uses flipped UV, because that's how Vanilla Minecraft does it)
- Fixed:
  - Barycenter objects not rendering
  - Sun showing up at night


## 0.2.3 Hotfix - 2024 May 24 - 1.19.2~1.19.4, 1.20.1
- Fixed:
  - Galaxy API problems that can cause crashes related to compatibility
