Space Objects represent nearly everything you see in the night sky, they contain the information on how an object should behave and what it looks like.

The following are considered Space Objects:
* [Planets and Moons](https://moddedmc.wiki/cs/project/stellarview/docs/resourcepacks/planets_and_moons)
* [Stars](https://moddedmc.wiki/cs/project/stellarview/docs/resourcepacks/stars)
* [Black Holes](https://moddedmc.wiki/cs/project/stellarview/docs/resourcepacks/black_holes)
* [Nebulae](https://moddedmc.wiki/cs/project/stellarview/docs/resourcepacks/nebulae)
* [Star Fields](https://moddedmc.wiki/cs/project/stellarview/docs/resourcepacks/star_fields)

## Definition

* `parent` *OPTIONAL* - References another object as this object's parent.
* `coords` **REQUIRED** - Specifies the space coordinates of the object.
* `axis_rotation` **REQUIRED** - Specifies the rotation of the object around its individual axes (X axis -> Z axis -> Y axis).

## `parent`

Parent field is used to define an object's parent-child relationship. If a Parent can't be rendered, its children won't be rendered as well. Additionally, child objects can have their position be relative to the paren't position

### Definition

* `location` *REQUIRED* - Defines the path (Resource Location) the object's [parent](https://moddedmc.wiki/cs/project/stellarview/docs/resourcepacks/space_objects).
* `relative` *OPTIONAL* - If set to true, the Space Object's relative coordinates and rotation will center around the parent. If not defined, it will be true by default.
For example: If a star is defined with `coords` equal to `(0, 2, 1)` and it references a galaxy at `coords` equal to `(0, 40, 0)` as its parent, the star's absolute position will be `(0, 42, 1)`, `axis_rotation` behaves similarly.

Examples of parent definition:

Orion is a child of Milky Way, but its coordinates aren't centered around Milky Way's center:  
`"parent": { "location": "stellarview:star_field/spiral_galaxy/milky_way/milky_way", "relative": false },`

Earth is a child of Sol and its coordinates are centered around it:  
`"parent": { "location": "stellarview:star/milky_way/sol" },`
