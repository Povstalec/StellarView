Space Objects represent nearly everything you see in the night sky, they contain the information on how an object should behave and what it looks like.

The following are considered Space Objects:
* [Planets and Moons](https://moddedmc.wiki/cs/project/stellarview/docs/resourcepacks/planets_and_moons)
* [Stars](https://moddedmc.wiki/cs/project/stellarview/docs/resourcepacks/stars)
* [Black Holes](https://moddedmc.wiki/cs/project/stellarview/docs/resourcepacks/black_holes)
* [Nebulae](https://moddedmc.wiki/cs/project/stellarview/docs/resourcepacks/nebulae)
* [Star Fields](https://moddedmc.wiki/cs/project/stellarview/docs/resourcepacks/star_fields)

### Parent Space Object

If a parent is defined for a Space Object, the Space Object's relative coordinates and rotation will center around the parent.
For example: If a star is defined with `coords` equal to `(0, 2, 1)` and it references a galaxy at `coords` equal to `(0, 40, 0)` as its parent, the star's absolute position will be `(0, 42, 1)`, `axis_rotation` behaves similarly.
