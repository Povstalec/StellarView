A View Center defines what you will be able to see in the sky when you are looking at it in a certain [Dimension](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Dimension).

To make Stellar View recognize your json file as a Star, put it inside the `assets/<namespace>/stellarview/celestials/star` folder in your [Resourcepack](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Resource_pack).

* **[Examples of View Centers](https://github.com/Povstalec/StellarView/blob/main/src/main/resources/assets/minecraft/stellarview/view_centers)**
