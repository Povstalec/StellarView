Due to the fact that Stellar View is primarily a client-side mod, it allows you to change just about every aspect of the mod through the use of Resourcepacks.

There are 3 categories of things you can change using Resourcepacks:

### View Centers

[View Center](https://moddedmc.wiki/cs/project/stellarview/latest/docs/resourcepacks/view_centers) allows you to view the universe with some [Space Object](https://moddedmc.wiki/cs/project/stellarview/docs/resourcepacks/space_objects) as the center you're viewing everything from.

* **[[Examples of View Centers](https://github.com/Povstalec/StellarView/tree/main/src/main/resources/assets/minecraft/stellarview/view_centers)]**

### Space Objects

[Space Objects](https://moddedmc.wiki/cs/project/stellarview/docs/resourcepacks/space_objects) are nearly everything you will see in the sky at night, from galaxies and stars to planets and moons.

### Celestial Effects

Celestial Effects don't change anything on their own, but they can be referenced by other objects that share similar behaviour.
