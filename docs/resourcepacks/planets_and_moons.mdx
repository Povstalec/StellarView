# Planets

As of now, Planets are a subtype of [Orbiting Objects](https://moddedmc.wiki/cs/project/stellarview/docs/resourcepacks/space_objects) with no additional functions.

To make Stellar View recognize your json file as a Planet, put it inside the `assets/<namespace>/stellarview/celestials/planet` folder in your [Resourcepack](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Resource_pack).

* **[Examples of Planets](https://github.com/Povstalec/StellarView/tree/main/src/main/resources/assets/stellarview/stellarview/celestials/planet)**



# Moons

Moons are a subtype of Planets, but have one additional property which Planets don't have.

To make Stellar View recognize your json file as a Moon, put it inside the `assets/<namespace>/stellarview/celestials/moon` folder in your [Resourcepack](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Resource_pack).

* **[Examples of Moons](https://github.com/Povstalec/StellarView/tree/main/src/main/resources/assets/stellarview/stellarview/celestials/moon)**

## Definition

* `compatibility` *OPTIONAL* - In the below example, we take a section from the [definition of Luna](https://github.com/Povstalec/StellarView/blob/main/src/main/resources/assets/stellarview/stellarview/celestials/moon/milky_way/sol/earth/luna.json#L60-L63).
We can see a field called *compatibility*. This field is used for compatibilities with other mods.

In this case, we specify that when [Enhanced Celestials](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/enhanced-celestials) is used, 
Players in [Overworld](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Overworld) will see Luna change as the effects of Enhanced Celestials dictate, but these changes won't be visible from other dimensions.

	"compatibility":
