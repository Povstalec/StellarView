* **Noobly Walker** - Added most of the moons currently found in Stellar View's Sol System, chose default colors for the 7 basic Stellar Classes, added all of the nebulae, made/added much more stuff which I currently can't remember and generally helped greatly with the development of this mod.


* **tehgreatdoge** - Made code for approximating eccentric anomalies of elliptical orbits.


* **Erdragh** - Updated Stellar View to 1.21.1 NeoForge and made the mod not crash with Iris.
